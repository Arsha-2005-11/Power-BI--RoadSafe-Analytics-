Fact Table
The Fact Table is the central table in a star or snowflake schema that stores quantitative metrics of a business process. It usually contains numeric data like sales amount, accident count, or revenue, and includes **foreign keys** linking to dimension tables.  

Dimension Table
The Dimension Table contains descriptive attributes that provide context to the facts. It holds categorical or textual information such as road type, weather, location, or time.  


That is,
- Fact tables focus on metrics, dimension tables focus on descriptions.  
- Fact tables link to multiple dimension tables** using foreign keys.  
- Common schema designs: Star Schema (fact table in center, dimension tables around) or **Snowflake Schema** (dimension tables normalized).
